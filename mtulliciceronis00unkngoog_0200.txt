sa. Verum autern....ectremum] As Bonnell remarks, the conclusion

’1. Quoe vacent injustitia] Oomp. 1, ’1, 2; 111, 19, 4. Β.

8. Hoee . . . . virtue] scil. justitia, which is easily supplied from the pre·
oeding senteme3 es Zumpt says: e vacatione injustitia eogitatur justitia.
It should be remarked, however, that Orelli and Bonnell have quoe non

- vacent justitia, instead of the reading of Heusinger and Zumpt. The text

is very doubtful. Heusinger says: Quid Cieero velit, appetem quid florip-
serit incertum est.

11. Ab homine . . . . detraxeris] We have in this seetion detrahere with
ah,- with de, ἓξ 12, 143 with the dative, §g 4, ¹7. Β. It will be reedily'

Cn. VII. The foregoing chapters are in form introductam-y, and yet they
ocntain the essenee of Gicem’s ideas on the subject of this book. That
whieh follows seems to oonsist of repetitions end illustratione of those idem
Gai-ve.

1. Aliqui ouem] Ζ. Gr. ξ 135.

2. Ex euperem-ihm . . . ,poesia In order to explain ex, most eommen-
tatere give emit the meaning of extant. Bonnell, however, prefers to oon-
sider it en enallage, by which the ex, which properly belongs to quibus
oen-epid pouit, is anticipeted and eonneeted with asperioribus libris.
