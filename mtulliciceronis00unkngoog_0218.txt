On examination, it will be found that more than ordinary labor has
been expended upon this work, and that the author has proeeeded upon
higher principles, and has had higher aims in view than historieal eom·
pilers ordinarily propose to themselves. Instead of being a mere eata·
logne of events, chronologically arranged, itis a eareful, lebni-icus, and
insti-notive digest oi the lawe, ensi-oms, manners, institutions, and eivi
lization of the ancient and modern natione.

The department oi* medem history in particular has been prepared
with unusual care an'd industry.
