Aristo of Chios, and Herillus of Oartliage were Stoics3 Pyrrho was the
founder of the sect of the Skepties. They agreed in considering all exter-
nal things indifferent—in denying that they should be reckoned among

 

things good or evil. 1. Pyrrho taught this by denying all grounds of {ruth
For, if in the case of our objects of thought there is never any reason for Ι

considering them, or any one of them, true rather than false, then of course
there is never any true ground for asserting that any exter-nal object is
good, or a proper object of desire or preference. “Pyrrho is said to be the
originator of the doctrine that there is no difference between health and
sickness, life and deatw ’

2. Ariste, like Hei-illus, deviated from Zen0, their common teacher and
the founder of their sect. He rejected all parts of philosophy except ethim,
'and even limited the domain of ethice itself, for he taught that its object

is not to treat of particular duties and encouragements ιο virtue, but that ¹

it is the province of the philosopher to show wherein the supreme good
consists. “ With Arist0, naught is of worth but virtue, nothing is evil but
vice. He seeks to rei-ute the opinion that there is such a difference in ex—
terna-l things ‚that one is preferable ιο another.”

3. Herfflus limits the virtue of the sage ,ιο sciense and knowlede He
considers practical life, which is occupied about external things, as simply

necessary, and denies it to be beautiful, on the ground that it does not ’

contribute aught to the supreme good.
