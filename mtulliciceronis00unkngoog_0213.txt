PRIMARY SPELLER ΑΜ) READER.

BY ALBERT D. WRIGHT.
Priee.12} Oents.

This little volume of 144 pagos eombines a Primary spelling-book
and Reader, happily illustrated with numerous euts, intended to attmt
the attention of the young, and to suggest thought for oral instruction
and conversation.

It is confidently believed, that the proper use of this little book will
obviate most of the difficulties experieneed at the commeneement of a
ohild’s education.

As fast as the letters are learned, an application is immediately
made of them.

No word is given in which a letter oecurs that has not been pre·
vions y learned.

'Ibe capital letters are taught one at a time, and by review in read-
ing leesons.

The words are systematieally presented, being elassified by their
vowel sounds and terminating consonants3 and generally, at the end
of eaeh elasa, they are arranged into little spelling lessons.

The learner is immediately initiated into reading lessons, compo-ed

οἱ words of two or three letters, andis then led progressively into mor·

difficule. words.
