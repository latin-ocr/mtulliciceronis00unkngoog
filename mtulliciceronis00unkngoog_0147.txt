Stoies, while they maintained that virtue alone was to be sought forits own
sake, nevertheless eonceded that external things, although none of them
eould be eelled a genuine good or a real evil, were yet valuable, and that
different exter-nal things differed in velue, and might be preferred one to
another. Gomp. Ritter’s Hist. Ano. Philosophy, mslated by Morrison,

Ηοσ quidem tempore] For 0ieero, although an eclectio, was rather in-
clined to the philosophy of the N ew Academy than to thet of the Stoies.

12. ,Α ratione] Zumpt, personifying ratio, makes this the ablativo of the
voluntas-y agent. Gemhaffl, like Zumpt, makes the clause equivalent to
quam ratio suscipit. Beier omits the preposition„ Bonnell retains a with
its common signification, and translates: vom Wesen der Saehe ausgehend,
proeeeding from Goerenz gives it the signification which it has in such
phrasesasabhac parte,a qua parte. It maybe translated as follows:

The Stoies divide duties (τὰ καθήκοντα, efficia) first into perfect, ([έλειιιρι

Hoc autem comum officium vocant] Most editors insert καθῆκον, after
<fficium Heusinger and Zumpt reject it as wanting authority, and make
efficium, the corresponding Latin word, its substitute. But this common
(duty, i. e., that which men commonly mean when they speak of duty‚)
they call qffieiwm- Heusinger, however, refers hoe to mdimn officium above,
and connects omnnium with officim in the predicate, the expression being
then equivalent to μὲσο vr καθῆκον ν. The following rernm-ks, translated and
