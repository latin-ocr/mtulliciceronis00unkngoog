been added by the American editor. Most of the derived notes, besides
being uanslated, have been very much changed in their form, by being
abridged, condensed, and otherwise modified3 and in some cases so
much so, that it seemed hardly fair toimp'ute the note in its new shspe
to its real author. Some commenta, therefore, will appear to be claim-
ed for this edition as original, which, by suggestion at least, are due to
another. But it will be very easy for any one, who has the authors
. enumerated in the beginning of this presses, to see for himself to what
extent the notes are derived from others. A slight compar-ison will
show that the present editor has hod little to do, but to use his judg-
ment, in selecting from the abundant materials furnished by able schol-
ars, and in preparing what he should select for American studente.
No part of the writings of Cicero has been more fortunate than the
De Officiis in respect to the preservation and perfecting of its text, nor
will it suffer in compar-ison with any in regard ιο the ability with which
its text has been illusuated and explained. If the book, now, not with-
out diffidence, presented to the public, shall have contributed any thing
ιο make the valuable labore of others more extensively available, its

· - object will have been accomplished. It has been prepared in the midst

of other duties, and retarded in its preparation by the repeated and pro-
tracted illness of its editor, and might put in a plea for the indulgence
which it will doubtless need.

In the first chapter of the second book, Cicero expresses the appre-
hension‚ that some good men mey find fault with his devotion ιο philos-
ophy. He vindicates himself, however, by saying that he can no
longer benefit the commonwealth by his care and counsels, inasmuch
as it is now under the tyrannical control of one man. He must,
therefore, give his activity a new direction. To yield ιο patriotic grief,
in view of the sad change in the state, would soon exhaust and pros-
trate him. To give himself up to pleasureffi at such an emergency,
would be unworthy of a man of his cultivation. He turns, therefore,
to philosophy for relies. It had been a favorite study of his youth, and,
in the midst of active life, he ⁸hed devoted to it what time he could gain
from professional and political duties. Nor does he turn to philosophy
for relief merely. He is still influenced by patriotic motives3 for he
has in view the reputation of Rome and the elevation of his couno-y·
men.
