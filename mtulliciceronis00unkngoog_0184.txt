5. Having shown that manis the chief source of good and ill to man,
Cicero proceeds now to the connection of this fact with ethics. The obscu-

by Garve: 11· therefore this proposition is beyond a doubt—that nothing is
so useful and so harmful to men as man—it also seems to me to be estab-

 

lished, that it is virtue which makes the hearts of men our own, and inspires i
them with the dispositione which our interests require. That utility then ς
which accrues to human life from inanimate objects and from the use and ⁴

management of animale, although it also eomes to us throuqh mess, is yet
the work of only a class of them, to wit, common laborers and those en-

gaged in the mechanic arts. But the advantages which we can derive 3

from the good-will and attachment of men in general for the promotion of Ψ
our happiness or our advancemenss these the great [and wise man inust '

secure for himself by his virtues.
