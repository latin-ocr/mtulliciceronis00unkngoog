9. Μσρίεφισ de imitatrici] In Crassus and Philippus it was more a
natmal endowment in Oaesar the result of study. Ooncerning this Caesar,
whose cognomen was Strabo, see Cic. Brutus, cap. 48. Philippus is spoken
of in the same work, cap. 47, and‘ Scaurus, cap. 29.——M. Druso adoles-
cente] Probably M. Livius Drusus, who was an opponent of O. Gracchus.
In Cic. Brut. he is called vir et oratione gravis et auctoritate—In q‘m . . . .
tristior] This clause Garve freely translates thus: his friend Scipio, αι
the other hand, was more occupied with the projects of his ambition, and
less interested in the pleasures of society.

10. Atque . . . . simulatorem] He was accustomed to pretend ignor-anco,
oyem imper-imm et admiratorem aliorum tanquam sapientum. Quintil.

11. Callidum Hannibalem . . . . accepimus facile celare, ete] accepimus
is the perfect definite, and is nevertheless connected with the present infini-
tive in a narrative of what is past. Z. Gr. ἓ 589. Bonnell suggests,
although he does not prefer, another construction, which, after a Greek
analogy, makes the infinitives depend on callidum—Proeripere] is a
strengen- expression than praecipere, which is the reading of some editions,
but rests on inferior authority.

12. In quo ywere] In which department, to wit, of ιιι-δε οι· accomplish-
ments.-- Vita q’m] Usage would require sua, for which the writer, as
if having forgotten, for the moment, that the subordinate clause expressed
the sentiment ,of the leading subject of the sentence, qui . . . . simulavit,
substituted qm. Madvig (ἓ 481, note 3.) attributes this deviation from
regularity to a want of care. He asserts, however, that it never occurs in
the case of a subj. acc. with an infinitive immediately connected with the
leading verb. For instance, amn would never be found in the place of ee,
in such a sentence as furere se simulavit. ·Oon1p. Z. Gnss 650, and Neue
Jahrb. Aliquanto] Oomp. 1, 2. 23, 6.

13. Multwn dispares] Gomp. ἓ 1 in this chap. and 21, 8. Ζ. Gr. ἓ 488.
'fist-her asserts, (Neue J ahrb.) that par and dispar are always connected
with the dative, except in the two passages cited by Zumpt, in his Gram-
mar, g 411.-—--Stmt . . . . qm· . . . . putant] The use of the indicative in
the relative clause shows that the subject of sunt is not indefinite in the
mind of Cicero—De insidiis] Heusinger says: ,De h. l. locale est. It
does not, therefore, differ essentially from ex, on which occulto depende.
Gomp. de transverso, de tergo. Heusinger adds: solent optimi scriptores
variare praepositiones. Thus Liv. 42„24. Ob nullam aliam causam nisi
propter constantem fidem.

14. callicratiam] See 24, 9.

15. Alium . . . . efficere] scil. accepimm.--- Unus de mtdtis] one of the
δι κολλοι- Q. Mucio Mancia} It is not known who Mucius Mancia was.
