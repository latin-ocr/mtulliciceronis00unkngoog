6, 7. Princepsque . . . . esse maximum] Ger-ve remarks, not without rea-
son, that Oicero's second metaphysica] reason at the first glauce seems to
lead to the opposite of that which he wishes to prove. ‘⁸ It seems absurd,
that, because a certain kind of wisdom is the first of an virtues, therefore
the effort to obtain wisdom is not the first of au duties. The opposite con-
clusion appears the most natural. If the knowledge of the nature of God
and man is the highest pel-fection, then, to be sure, the endeavor to secure
this knowledge, and consequently the investigetion of nature, must be the
first duty. Cicero nevertheless hits upon a mean, by which he unites the
two propositione apparently so contradictory. This wisdom, which is the
highest virtue of man, is the knowledge of the relations in which he stands3
and these relations, so fer as he can survey them, are no other than those
in which he stands to God and his fellow—men.” Anmerkungen, 1, 212.

6. Coyitatio in se ipsa vertitur] Bonnell is in doubt whether se is in

with either construction. Heusinger considers se accusative.
