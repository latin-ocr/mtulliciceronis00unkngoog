viii pannon.

,But while Cicero thus defends his occupatiori to the public, 110 has ιι
private and perhaps a more weighty reason for the composition of this

philosophical treatise-a reason which should not be lost sight of in ¹

reading it, for it gives a key to the character of the work. The mo-
tive referred to is his desire to instruct his son.

Hc had sent him to Athens to pursue the study of philosophy under
Cratippus3 but moved by some unfavorable reports respecting his con-
duct there, he had determined to visit him. A storm interrupted his
voyage soon after 110 had weighed anchor, and drove him back to the
shore of Italy, and news from Rome prevented his setting sail again.
He wrote this treatise, therefore, as a substitute' for the oral connsel
which he had intended to give. This fact—the fact that the work is
addressed by Cicero 10 his son—glires direction 10 1110 course of thought
contained init. Itis not a code of morals for mankind in general, but
it is particularly adapted to the circumstances of the son of a distin-

guished Roman statesman, who might be expected to seek distinction ’
111 public life as his father had done. 'Phe book, therefore, does not Α

address itself to the middle and lower classes, except as the general

principles embodied and discussed in it are applicable to their condi· ἶ

11011. The examples and illustratione are all drawn from the highest
offices in the state and from the highest walks of life. Thus the value

of the treatise as a philosophical work is perhaps diminished by the ’ἵ

contraction of its scope, while the interest in it is increased by the fre-
quent display of parental regard. ¹

This single remark respecting the design of the work is all that is
necessary here by way of introduction. What has been deemed requi-
site for aid to the learner in understanding its basis and plan, as well
’ as its terms, will be found in the notes!
