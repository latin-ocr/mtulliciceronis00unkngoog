Annum jam audientem] Cicero sent his son to Athens about the first
of April, B. 0. 45, 85 we leam from a letter written by him to Atticus the
next year, (Ep. ad Atticum XV. 15 ,) 111 which, speaking of his son, he says·

scripsit, sibi, post Kal. ApriL—sic enim annwm tempu-s confici—nihil dae ”

111111 8558. Α5 118 says in the text that his 5011 1185 been hearing Cratippus
8 year, it 15 inserted that Cicero began this treatise 111 1118 spring, or early
in the summer 44 B. 0., two or three months at most after the 8558551118-
tion of Oaesar.

On the other hand, the following reasons may be given for believing that
the treatise was not commenced till the autumn of 1118 same year: 1. In
the very frequent letters of this period, which give us almost the (1811]Γ 08-
cupations of Cicero, there is no mention of 8 work de Officiis till 081. 24,
(Ep. ad Att„ XV. 13.) 2. Cicero implies (de Off. ΠΙ. 33) 11181 11115 book
was intended as a substitute for the instruction ‚which he had designed
giving 1115 5011 111 person at Athens. It may be supposed, therefore, that it
was written after the project of visiting Greece was abandoned. He in-
forms us (Ep. ad Att. XVI. 7) that having set out on the voyage, he was
driven back 10 1118 vicinity of Rhegium on the sixth of August, and was
induced 10 give up his visit to his son, and return to Rome, by the repre-
sentatione of his friends that 8 favorable change in public affairs had taken

place, and that his presence was demanded He reached the capital the “

1851 day of August, and having, on the second of September, delivered his
first Philippic, retired soon after to his country-seat Puteolanum. Here 118
spent 1118 months of October and November, and 15 supposed 10 have em-
ployed himself m writing this work. It 15 agreed that it was finished be-
fore the ninth of December.

A. W. Zumpt suggests that the disagreement here set forth may be
reconciled by supposing that the young Cicero, although he left home the
first of April, did not for some time actually commence his attendance
