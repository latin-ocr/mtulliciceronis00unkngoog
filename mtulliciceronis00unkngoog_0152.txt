i. e. transferring the idea of beauty, dte„ from the objects of vision to the*
attributes of the soul. Oomp. B. and Garve.

Commandum] Z. Gr. ἓ 376.

9. Etiamsi nobilitatum non sit] This is aimed at the opinion of Epicu-
rus: qui neque se intelli-qen quid sit hmtestwm, si id non est in voluptate,
nisisorte illud, quod multitudinis rumore laudatur. (Fin.
21⁶.)

Honestum est] est has been preferred to sit in this edition. Zumpt re-
tains the sit of Heusinger, the construction being similar to that of the sub-
junctive in the apodosis 1n chapter 2, 6. Beier and Orelli prefer est.

,A nullo] used substantively instead of uenum Z. Gr. ξ 67 6.

In this fourth chapter Cicero enters on the discussion of the hernestum,
by making a cursor-y examination of the nature of man, designing thereby

’ω settle the basis of his subsequent subdivision of the hommem into the
four cardinal virtues, viz„ justitia, (see ἓ 4,) sapientia, (see ἓ 5,) maynitndo
animi, (g 6,) temperantia, (ἓ ’1 and ἓ 8.)

On. V. 1. Formam . . . . sapientioe] somnam embodiesffaeiem personifies,
moral goodnesa Doederlein, IV. 318. Cicero refers to this passage,
Phaedrus of Plato, (see 65,) in the second book de Finibus c. 16, where he
&anslates it as follows: omnim-um est in nobis sensus acerrimus, quibus σω
pientiam non cernimus ; quam illa ardentes amores excitaret sui, si vide-
retur 1

2. Rerum contractarum] fidelity in reqard to connects. Instead of res
contractae, amiradus was afterwards used. 0

8. Quoe prima descripta est] which was first set off (from the rest.) Sapi-
entia and prudentia are the moral qualities which correspond to the per-
spicientia veri sollertiaque, while indaqatio atque inventio vm· are the cor-
responding moral duties. B.

Velut ex ea parte. ..inestJ Bythis anacoluthon Cicero avoids the repe-
tition of naseuntur, the last word of the preceding sentence.

&usque virtutis] scil. sapientiae et prudentioe‚ which are not distinguished
here as in Ghap. 43.

4. Ut enim quiaque. Aa] Another example of anacoluthon, occasioned
by the introduction of the relative clause: quique, etc. Otherwise sie or ita
would have followed to correspond with ut.

5. Huic] scil. virtuti.

Reliquis autem tribus virtutibus] scil. justitie, sortiwdini, temperantia.

Necessitates] the necessary external relations of life. B. Compare 44,
10. The field of the three remaining virtues is human needs, and laboring
here, it is their business to create and preserve those things in which prac-
tical life (life's action) is comprised. ,Thus justitia has to do with the ω·
