Man has his own regularly constituted nature. Au the faculties of his
being have certain tendenciea If this natm-e exist in its entire complete-
ness and extent, if all these tendencies are fully satisfied‚ then the man is
virtuous, All that such a man does is good, is κατόρθωμα, 10 perfect duty.
It may perhaps, in the eyes of the whole world, not be different from that
which the ordinary, or even the bad man does3 it may perhaps, in relation
to the good of society, be of equal value, but within it has a spirit altogether
different—a different power. The one man works always with all the
taculum of 0 perfect 00111, and these faculties in mutual union and in har-
tanny: The other 10, 00 10 speak, called out and determined only by the
occasion. True virtue is an ever· burning fire, which produces of itself light
and heat. The virtue of the imperfect man is 0 113111. kindled for the oc-
casion, a warmth imparted for the moment.

An act may be adapted to circumstances and satisfy some visible rela-
110110. It may benefit many and harm no one. And then the great portion
of mankind call it upright and ask nothing more. But the sharper eye of the
philosopher searches deeper. It sees a great difference between the man-
ner in which this act is performed by the wiso man, on the one hand, and
by the common man on the other—by him whose character is thoroughly
and always upright‚ and by him who determines to do right this time in
view only of motivae derived from present circumstances. From this comes
the Greek name given by the Stoics to such a duty, and their definition
which Oioero here introduces. They call such 0 duty καθῆκον, the auita-
hle, tlte fittinq, and define it as an act for which rational grounds ean 110
given.

The reflecting reader will be struck by this, and ask. Can there be a
higher goodn‘ess of 00110110, than that of having performed them according
to reason? “Certainly not,” would the 81010 answer, “if it were the com-
pletely enlightened reason. The definition does not mean to say that the
duties commonly required and performed in human life, are altogether m ·
0000τά01100 with reason, but that they can be justified. Moreover, in the
case of a perfect act, which we 0011ωπ-αῃόρθωμ the whole of the conductis
taken into view; in the case of that which we callae ακονθῆ ,only individual
acts, separate from the rest. Each act attains exact moral rectitude only
by its union with the whole life. The life of the wise man is 0 harmonicus
whole; the life of the fool consists of fragments. There are times when
the latter has become attentive to circumstances, and has found ⁴out what
he ought to do, and there are times when he has only followed his undis-
ciplined nature. The wise man ever acts according to character, and this
is good. Duties of the inferior sort are performed rather from a considera-
tion of circumstances3 duties of the higher kind, from the inne: impulses
of the soull’

It is now easy to understand, that according to these ideas, the Stoice
were obliged 10 consider all perfect duties equal, and to allow no degree·
