on the instructions of Cratippum and further, that Cicero does not intend
to speak with emctness in using the words annum jam audientem. Comp
Z. B. Beier de Off. Π. 417. A.andS.,§ 146,I.2.

Oratippmn] Cicero's opinion of this master of the Peripatetic school
maybe learned from §Sosthis sectionstrom 111,2,2. and de FinLS

quue Athenis] Z. Gr. ἓ 699. The ease of this pronoun may be learned
from the nature of the clause which it represents. An illustration of the
principle may be derived from the examples from Euripides, cited in
Orosby’s Gr. Gr. ἓ 334. Ἑλένην κτάνωμεν, Μενέλεῳ λύπην πικράν. Here λύπην
is in the accusative case, beeause the clause to which it refers contains a
transitive verb and its object. The writer, having one and the same thing
in his mind all the time, gives the same form to his thoughts in both clauses.
Let uo day Helen, [let us cause] a bitter- grief to Menelaus. In the other
example the nominative case is used. Στὲφη μιαίνεται, θεῶν ἄτιμα, our yar-
landa are profaned, [which is] a dishonor to the pods.

Praeceptis institutisque] principles and practical mles. The former
word refers to theoretical philosophy—the latter, to the practical rules of
lise.

In utriunque orationis facultate] that you may have equal faeility in
both styles of diseourse‚ namely, the oratorical and the philosophical. That
such is the meaning of these words would appear from the next sentence,
which can scarcely be interpreted satisfactorily if the author be supposed
to refer to the Greek and Latin languages in the words utrimque orationis.
The meaning of the sentence seems to be substantially this: As Ι have
found it advantageous in philosophy and oratory, to give my attention to
Greek as well as Latin studies, I advise you to do the same, that you may
have equal readiness as an orator and a philosopher.

The proper correlative of ut would be ita. Instead of it we find idem,
which, according to Gernhard‚ refers not to ut but id. May not this be
considered a slight additional reason for the interpretation of utriusque om-
tiom’s which is given in this note? G. B.

2. Ut videmur] Z. Gr. ἓ 880.

Docti] Cicero called those indocti who were unacquainted with Greek
literature. See Aead. Quaest. 1, 2.

Aliquantum] Z. Gr. §482

Et ad dicendum et adjudicandum] for their aid not only as oratore, but
also as philosopher-s.

3. Diaces tu quidem . . . . et disces] For similar repetition for the sake of
emphasis, see 25, 10„ 2⁹1, ’1. The future is here a softened imperative.
Z. Gr. ξ 586. Tu quidem. Z. Gr. g 278.

Utrique] that ie, both the sects, (the New Academy and the Peripatefiffi)
to one of which Oicern, to the other Cratippus, belonged. Ζ. Gr. ἓ 141.

Impodio] Observe that the singular number is used, notwithstanding
