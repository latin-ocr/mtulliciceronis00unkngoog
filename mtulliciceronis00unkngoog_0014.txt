scanty. The example of the German editors already named, and in-
deed of almost 811 German commentators, can, it is true, be quoted for

8 different course. But it should be borne in mind that they prepare ⁸ ⁸

their works for those who ure not supplied with these books of refer-
ence. A German commentery is 8 transcript of the instructions of the
class-roem, where orel teaching takes the place of silent study, end, to
8 great extent, supplies the' want of manuels. Such 8 commentury
therefore contains 811 the explanatione which its author has been ac-
customed to give to his class3 not only grammaticul and critical com·
ments, but those also which pertain to geography, history, biography,
end antiquities. It shouldbe observed, however, that German pupils
do not, us 8 general rule, make use of such commentarios, but of the
unsdorned text of the authors they study. In this edition, 8 few note's
of the historica] class spoken of have been introduced, in ceses where
the dictinum-ies in common use have not been found to contain the de-
sired information.

The general design of the brief commentary is two-sold: first, to “

eid the learner in understnnding the contente of the treatise, the
thoughts and connectione of thought of the author3 end second, to
explain gmmmsticel difficulties, and especially to inculcata 8 know-
ledge of grammatical principles. The editor has aimed throughout to
guide rather than carry the ieamer through difficulties, requiring of
him more study in consequence of his help, than he would probably
have devoted to the ‘book without it. There will be found frequent
references to the gemmare where there is no difficulty in translating
and understanding the author, and that for the mere purpose of in-
forming or reminding the leurner of some lew of the lnnguuge. To
some these references will undoubtedly seem too numerous. They

will seem to leave to the careful student too little opportunity to ex· .

ercise his own ingenuity, to leave him no difficulties to solve himself.
There is much force in this objection, and in the preparation of some
works for the use of learners it ought to prevail. But yet, considering
the atteinments of the great body of studente who would be likely to
read this book3 would not more on the whole be gained by 8 multipli-
cation of references than by their omission Ἰ Besides, numerous us
they are, they do not comprise 811 thet ure inserted by Zumpt himself
in his edition, not 8 few having been omitted, as unnecesserily directing
the attention of the learner to principles, with which, it might be taken
for granted, that he was already sufficiently familiar. On this point,
therefore, the error, if there is one, is probably on the side of scantiness.

The notes are not 811 referred to their sources. Of those which are
