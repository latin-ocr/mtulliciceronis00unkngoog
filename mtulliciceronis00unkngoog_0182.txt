enatam] Compare Ι, 3, ’7. Zumpt, in a note on the passage under eon·
sideration, translates facultatem, possession and use. Cicero himself (de

 

Invent. Ι, 27, end) defines this word thus: Facultates ruht, aut quibus fo· i

cilius fit, aut sine quibus aliquid confici non potest. B. This would be a.

8. Bonis viris] Zumpt thinks that· these words express a little irony,

tolaus were, by a decree of the senate, driven out of the city, because they
taught the Greek philosophy there. See Aul. Gellius, Noct. Att. XV, 11
