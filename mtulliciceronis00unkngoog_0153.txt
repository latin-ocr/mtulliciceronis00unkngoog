6. Ordo . . . . conservabimus] The virtue of temperantia remains to be
oriefly described. Cicero particulaiizes ordo, constantia, moderatio, because
there is no one word in Latin which exactly corresponds with the Greek
σωφροσύνη. In the first of these two sentences he repeats what is stated
with less prominence in the preceding sentence, Reliquis . . . . eontimwr,
namely, that these virtues and the like (all belonging to the fourth in order)
have their ephoro in that department of thinye to which (external) activity is
to be applied, in which respect they differ from sapientia, whose duties (in-
dayatio atq-ue inventio veri) require mentis aqitatio. 'rho last sentence
brings out the practical duty of the fourth virtue (his rebus, quae tractantur
in vita, modum quendam et ordinem adhibere) and its aim, (honestatem et
decus conservare.) B.
