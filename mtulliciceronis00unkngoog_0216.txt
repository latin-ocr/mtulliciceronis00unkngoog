The present Manuals of Greek and Roman Antiquities are far supe
rior to any thing on the same topice as yet offered to the American
public. A principal Review of Germany says of the Roman Manual:
‘small as the compass of it is, we may confidently affirm that it is a
great improvement on all preceding works of the kind. We no longer
meet with the w'retched old method, in which subjeets esset tially dis*
tinet are hei-ded together, and connected subjects dioeonnected, but
have a simple, systematic arrangement, by which the reader readily
receives a clear representation of Roman life. We no longer stumble
against countless eri-ors in detail, which, though long ago assailed and
extirpated by Neibuhr and others, have found their last place of refuge
in our manuals.”

education.

“The principal alterations from the original are a new and more
convenient. division of paragraphs, and entire omission of the conver·
satiens annexed to the chapters. In the place of these I have affixed
questions to every page that may at once facilitate the work of the
toacher and tho pupil. The rational and moral features of this book
first commended itseR to me, and Ι have used it successfully with my κ
