6. Intelliyendum eat] “Although intelliyendum eet often occurs in this
work m the sense of intelliqitur or facile potest intelli9i‚ still it implius, at
tho same time, that itis proper or becoming to see or understand.” Ζ. Gr.
ξ 650. ’-Ηοιιεείαε] differs from honestum of the preceding sentence as the
absh-act differs from the.0oncrete.—Manaret] Z. Gr. ἓ 514.—Am‘mo]
is not the ablative of the voluntem-y agent.

’1. In promptu] at the ιωιριιέε θοαί-δι’ quid tale diei potest] i. e. if the
ease allows the use of any such quotation—Illa viv-ayo viri] sc. animvm
yar-it. Supposed to be a quotation from Ennius respect-ing Cloelia—E!
a· quid q‘uamodi] ecdici potest—Salmous· . . . . sanquine] Observe the
metaphorice] use of the proper name—Da spolia, dte, surrender your
cmm· without a etruyqle and without bloodehed. BonnelL adopting the
explanation of Elvenieli (Progr. Breslau, 1834) drops the comma after
apulia and makes sine sudore et sanquine attributive of spolia. Suu-render
yom- swendet-s, bloodlm arms, i. e. the arms which you have refused to use
in battle.

8. Qua.. ,foa-citer qesta cunt, ea laudamus] According to Madvig,
(tamin. Sprachlehre f. Schulen‚ ξ 324 ,) the antecedentis often placed after
the relative clause, when it is a demonstrative pronoun standing alone.

9. Hinc rhemum campus] Gomp. auct. dial. de Oratoribus: eet aliquio
oratorum campus, per quem nisi liberi et soluti ferantur, debilitatur αο fran-
qum eloquentia. Hine, hence, i. e. because we love to praise such deeds.
——Hino noster Cocles, hino Decii . . . . alii] The elder Heusinger supplies
exaltent, anticipating *it from the next clause. To this construction the
nephew objects. He prefers to supply only the substantive verb, as in the
preceding sentence, hino rhetorum, dvo. With this construction, the eonnec-
tion of thought would be: hence, (that is, because we bestow such praises
on bravo exploits‚) hence our Cocles, hence the Decii, dvc„ for without these
praises there would be no Cocles, his name would long since have passed
away. He might have been just as breve, to be sure, but without these
praises we should now have no such character in our history, for his name
would have been forgotten.

Such would be the connection of thought, unless Heusinger under-
stood that the general disposition to praise such conduct was the cause of
the bravery of Coeles· and the rest But this is improbable. Zumpt would
supply omnium eorummet-atione celebrantur, which falls in with the spirit
of the context—Declaratur autem . . . . quod statuas quoque] statues aleo,
not merely living men. Steurenburg.

Gn. XIX. See Conspectm—1.In vitio eet] Gomp. ’1, 8.
2. Eam virtutem em] eam is the subject, virtutem the predicate.
4. Audacia nomem habeat] Cicero drops from the periphrastic form

appellandus aa, which exact correspondence with the preceding sentem·
would require, into the pres. subj. with the imperative signification.
